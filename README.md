Playlist Coverart (JS)
===========

Taking the small ruby script I made and trying to create it with JS.

## What is it
A basic frontend that allows you to put the copy title for your playlist, when you hit submit it places the copy over the image in the 'active' static/images folder.
It will also greyscale and resize the image and then saves it to the export folder.
